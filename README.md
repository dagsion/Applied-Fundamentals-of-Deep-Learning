# Applied-Fundamentals-of-Deep-Learning

This repository serves as a documentation of implementing the Machine Learning model to create Artificial Intelligence that is useful for daily tasks.

All models are trained with the Google Colab cloud computing system and utilized Pytorch language for Machine Learning

This repository includes software for the following tasks:

    Introduction to PyTorch and Neural Networks
    Classification of Cats and Dogs
    Hand Gesture Recognition
    Data Imputation
    Spam Detection
